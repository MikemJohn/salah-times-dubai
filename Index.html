    <h1>Guide to Prayer Times in Dubai</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <p>Dubai is a modern city filled with cultural diversity and a strong connection to Islamic traditions. For Muslims, prayer times are an important part of daily life. These times are based on the sun's position and change slightly every day with the seasons. Here’s a simple guide to help you understand Dubai’s prayer schedule:</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Fajr (Before Dawn)</h2>
        <div class="prayer-time">
            <p>Fajr is the first prayer of the day, performed before sunrise. It starts when the first light appears on the horizon and ends just before the sun rises. In summer, Fajr in Dubai is early, around 4:30 AM, and later in winter.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Dhuhr (Midday)</h2>
        <div class="prayer-time">
            <p>Dhuhr is the midday prayer, starting just after the sun passes its highest point in the sky. This usually begins around noon and lasts until the Asr prayer approaches.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Asr (Afternoon)</h2>
        <div class="prayer-time">
            <p>Asr is prayed in the afternoon, starting when an object’s shadow is equal to its length. It continues until just before sunset. The exact timing can change depending on the day’s sunlight.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Maghrib (After Sunset)</h2>
        <div class="prayer-time">
            <p>Maghrib is offered right after the sun sets. The time lasts until the twilight fades, usually around 30 minutes to an hour after sunset.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Isha (Night)</h2>
        <div class="prayer-time">
            <p>Isha is the final prayer of the day. It begins after the sky is completely dark, typically around 8:00 PM in Dubai, and continues until midnight.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <p><a href="https://prayerstimedubai.com/">Prayer times in Dubai</a> are more than just reminders; they are part of the city’s routine. Mosques announce the call to prayer (<em>adhan</em>) to guide worshippers, and many people also use apps or check online for daily timings.</p>

    <p>Throughout the year, these times shift slightly as the days get longer or shorter. During Ramadan, Fajr and Maghrib prayers are especially significant, marking the start and end of fasting.</p>

    <p>Prayer times help bring moments of peace and connection to daily life in Dubai, even with its fast-paced lifestyle. They remind Muslims to pause, reflect, and stay connected to their faith.</p>
